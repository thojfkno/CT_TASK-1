Clean: Data Cleaning in Power Query
Data cleaning is a foundational step to ensure accuracy and consistency. The following transformations were applied using Power Query:

âœ… Removed duplicate rows to eliminate redundant data

âœ… Promoted headers correctly (used second row as column headers if needed)

âœ… Standardized column data types (e.g., Dates, Currency, Text)

âœ… Formatted date fields to use a consistent date format (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy)

Transform: Enhancing with DAX
To make analysis more efficient, the following DAX transformations were performed:

ðŸ“† Created a new column: Year = YEAR('Orders'[Order Date])

ðŸ“… Created another column: Month = MONTH('Orders'[Order Date])

These transformations simplify time-based analysis.
